PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current Challenges:

1. Manual Reporting Processes
   - Reports generated manually by staff
   - Inconsistent delivery times
   - Human error in report generation
   - Time-consuming process (5-10 hours/week per person)
   - Lack of historical data retention

2. Security and Access Concerns
   - Traditional VPN solutions expensive ($955-$1,788/month for 25 users)
   - Public IP addresses create security vulnerabilities
   - Exposed RDP ports (common attack vector)
   - Complex credential management
   - Lack of centralized audit trail

3. Operational Inefficiencies
   - No centralized reporting infrastructure
   - Reports generated from individual workstations
   - Inconsistent formatting and standards
   - Difficult to troubleshoot issues
   - No disaster recovery plan

4. Compliance Requirements
   - Need for complete audit trail
   - Requirement for secure access methods
   - Data retention policies not enforced
   - No encryption for sensitive reports

Business Impact:
- Lost productivity: 10-20 hours per week across team
- Security risks: Potential data breaches from exposed systems
- Compliance risks: Potential fines for non-compliance
- Opportunity cost: Staff time could be better utilized
