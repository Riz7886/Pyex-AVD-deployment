BUSINESS CASE

Standalone Bastion Reporting Server
Automated Reporting Infrastructure with Secure Access

Prepared for: Management Review and Client Presentation
Date: November 2, 2025
Version: 1.0
Classification: Internal Use

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Problem Statement:
Current manual reporting processes consume 10-20 hours per week of staff time, lack consistency, and expose security vulnerabilities through public IP addresses and traditional VPN infrastructure. Cisco AnyConnect VPN solutions cost $37,920-67,912 over 3 years for 25 users while requiring significant management overhead.

Proposed Solution:
Deploy a dedicated Windows Server 2022 reporting infrastructure with Azure Bastion secure access. This eliminates VPN costs, automates report generation, and provides enterprise-grade security without public IP exposure.

Financial Impact:
- Total 3-Year Cost: $10,080 (recommended configuration)
- Cost Savings vs Cisco VPN: $27,840-57,112 (73-84% reduction)
- Time Savings: 728 hours/year ($36,400 annual value at $50/hour)
- Total ROI: 1,260% over 3 years
- Payback Period: 1 month

Security Improvements:
- 90% reduction in attack surface (no public IPs on VMs)
- Zero-trust access architecture
- Entra ID authentication with MFA
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Meets SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PCI DSS standards

Recommendation:
APPROVE deployment of recommended configuration ($280/month) for immediate cost savings, improved security, and operational efficiency.

- Limited distribution capabilities

Security and Access Vulnerabilities:
- Traditional VPN solutions expensive ($11,460-21,456/year for 25 users)
- Public IP addresses create attack vectors
- Exposed RDP ports (most common attack method)
- Complex credential management across multiple systems
- Lack of centralized audit trail
- No MFA enforcement
- Compliance gaps

Operational Challenges:
- No centralized reporting infrastructure

Financial Impact of Current State:
- Lost productivity: 15 hours/week × $50/hour = $39,000/year
- VPN costs: $11,460-21,456/year (if using Cisco)
- Security incident risk: Potential $50,000+ per breach
- Compliance fines: Up to $100,000 per violation
- Opportunity cost: Staff time better spent elsewhere
